### Disable SELinux
# Note: we disable SELinux because of https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/23971, and because
# I don't have enough experience with SELinux to change the SELinux policy so that the overlays
# don't cause everything (e.g. sudo and chkpwd) to break after systemd-sysext enables filesystem
# overlays, and because this is just a demo anyways. If someone can fix the SELinux policies for
# this demo, please submit a pull request at
# https://github.com/ethanjli/ublue-forklift-sysext-demo/pulls!
